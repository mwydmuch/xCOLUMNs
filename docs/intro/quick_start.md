# Quick start

## Installation

The library can be installed using pip:
```sh
pip install xcolumns
```

It should work on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and with Python 3.8+.

## PyTorch support

The library supports PyTorch tensors as input/output data types.
However, the PyTorch is not a required dependency, so you need to install it separately if you want to use it.

## Usage

We provide a short usage guide (with examples) for the library in [short_usage_guide.ipynb](https://github.com/mwydmuch/xCOLUMNs/blob/master/short_usage_guide.ipynb) notebook.
