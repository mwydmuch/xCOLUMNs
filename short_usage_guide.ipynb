    "# xCOLUMNs Quick Usage Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the xCOLUMNs Quick Usage Guide. It aims to provide a quick overview of the xCOLUMNs library and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is xCOLUMNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "xCOLUMNs stands for x**Consistent Optimization of Label-wise Utilities in Multi-label classificatioN**s.\n",
    "It is a small Python library that aims to implement different methods for the optimization of a general family of \n",
    "metrics that can be defined on multi-label classification matrices. \n",
    "These include but are not limited to, label-wise metrics (see below for details). \n",
    "The library provides an efficient implementation of the different optimization methods that easily scale to the extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) - problems with a very large number of labels and instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is multi-label classification?\n",
    "Multi-label classification is a type of classification task, where each instance can be assigned to multiple labels. \n",
    "For example, a news article can be assigned to multiple categories, such as \"politics\", \"sports\", \"technology\", etc.\n",
    "The labels for each instance are usually represented as binary vectors $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}^m$, where $m$ is the number of possible labels, and $y_j = 1$ means that label $j$ is relevant for the given instance, and $y_j = 0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are label-wise utilities?\n",
    "The label-wise utilities are performance metrics that decompose over labels, i.e., they can be defined as a sum of individual metrics for each label:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\Psi(Y, \\hat{Y}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\psi^j(y_{:,j}, \\hat{y}_{:,j}) \\,,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $Y$ is the true label matrix, $\\hat{Y}$ is the predicted label matrix (both of size $n \\times m$, where $n$ is number of instances) and $y_{:,j}$ is the $j$-th column of $Y$, and $\\psi^j$ is binary utility function for label $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such metrics, under the assumption that are order-invariant, can be defined as a function of the confusion matrix, and can be decomposed over labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What methods are implemented in xCOLUMNs?\n",
    "The aim of xCOLUMNs is to provide methods for optimization of general family of label-wise utilities. Currently, the following methods are implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction for provided test set using **Block Coordinate Ascent/Descent (BC)** method, described in [1].\n",
    "- Search for optimal population classifier using **Frank-Wolfe (FW)** method, described in [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use xCOLUMNs?\n",
    "This guide will provide a quick overview of how to use xCOLUMNs for the optimization of label-wise utilities.\n"
